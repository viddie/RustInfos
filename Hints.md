# Hints

## Building

- Destroying a locked TC will eat 24 hours worth of upkeep, preventing the base from decaying. This is meant as a sort of griefing protection

## Shopping

- You can buy Smoke Grenades for 5x Scrap at the Outpost and recycle them for 18x Gun Powder each. That means you can convert Scrap to Sulfur at a rate of 139x Scrap for 1k Sulfur or 1k Scrap for 7194x Sulfur 

## Wipe Start

- For an easy but slower start, go to Outpost, destroy 4 road signs with your rock, recycle, purchase the Tactical Gloves and recycle those for 200 cloth. You can then make a Bow and a bunch of Sleeping Bags for your group
