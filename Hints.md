# Hints

## Building

- Destroying a locked TC will eat 24 hours worth of upkeep, preventing the base from decaying. This is meant as a sort of griefing protection.
- Learn multi TC. It's pretty cheap on resources and prevents people from griefing you without investing massively more gunpowder. There are a ton of building variations out there, but the premise is simple: Build an external TC and continue building towards your main base as far as possible to create overlapping building priv ranges. When your main TC is destroyed the external TC prevents any take over.
- Have a camp fire near all doors that can could be camped. If you light the camp fire and the comfort goes above 50% (assuming you have no ill effects), someone else is in the range of the camp fire.

## Shopping

- You can buy Smoke Grenades for 5x Scrap at the Outpost and recycle them for 18x Gun Powder each. That means you can convert Scrap to Sulfur at a rate of 139x Scrap for 1k Sulfur or 1k Scrap for 7200x Sulfur.

## Wipe Start

- For an easy but slower start, go to Outpost, destroy 4 road signs with your rock, recycle, purchase the Tactical Gloves and recycle those for 200 cloth. You can then make a Bow and a bunch of Sleeping Bags for your group.
- If you have trouble putting down a base because you always die while farming resources, focus on only collecting enough resources for a Stone Foundation, a TC and a Key Lock (300x Stone, 1125x Wood). From there on you have a somewhat secure storage and a location people at the start can't take away from you.
