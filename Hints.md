# Hints

## Wipe Start

- For an easy but slower start, go to Outpost, destroy 4 road signs with your rock, recycle, purchase the Tactical Gloves and recycle those for 200 cloth. You can then make a Bow and a bunch of Sleeping Bags for your group

## Building

- Destroying a locked TC will eat 24 hours worth of upkeep, preventing the base from decaying. This is meant as a sort of griefing protection
